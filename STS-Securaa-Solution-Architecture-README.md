## ‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture Considerations

### Scalability Planning
> **Design for Growth:** The architecture must accommodate 3-5 years of projected growth without major redesign. Consider both vertical and horizontal scaling options from the initial implementation.

```yaml
# Scalability planning framework
scalability_planning:
  growth_projections:
    data_volume:
      year_1: "10TB"
      year_3: "100TB"
      year_5: "500TB"
    
    user_base:
      current: "50 users"
      year_3: "500 users"
      year_5: "2000 users"
    
    event_processing:
      current: "10K events/sec"
      year_3: "100K events/sec"
      year_5: "1M events/sec"
  
  scaling_strategies:
    data_tier:
      - "Implement database sharding early"
      - "Use read replicas for read scaling"
      - "Implement data lifecycle management"
      - "Consider NoSQL for unstructured data"
    
    application_tier:
      - "Design stateless applications"
      - "Implement microservices architecture"
      - "Use container orchestration"
      - "Plan for auto-scaling capabilities"
    
    infrastructure:
      - "Use cloud-native services where possible"
      - "Implement infrastructure as code"
      - "Plan for multi-region deployment"
      - "Design for disaster recovery"
```

### Security by Design
> **Layered Security:** Implement security controls at every architectural layer, not as an afterthought. Security should be embedded in the design from the ground up.

```yaml
# Security-first architecture principles
security_by_design:
  design_principles:
    defense_in_depth:
      layers:
        - "Network security (firewalls, IPS)"
        - "Application security (WAF, input validation)"
        - "Data security (encryption, access controls)"
        - "Identity security (MFA, RBAC)"
        - "Endpoint security (agents, monitoring)"
    
    zero_trust_architecture:
      principles:
        - "Never trust, always verify"
        - "Least privilege access"
        - "Assume breach mentality"
        - "Continuous verification"
    
    privacy_by_design:
      requirements:
        - "Data minimization"
        - "Purpose limitation"
        - "Consent management"
        - "Right to erasure"
        - "Data portability"
  
  implementation_guidelines:
    secure_coding:
      - "Input validation and sanitization"
      - "Output encoding"
      - "Parameterized queries"
